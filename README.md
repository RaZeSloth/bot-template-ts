# Example ts bot template
Make more commands like so
```bath
commands
    ├── test
    │   └── test.ts 
    └── util
         └── somefile.ts
```
# Env
Example of the env

# Starting the project

First, you'd have to build the project with `yarn install` to start the bot run `yarn start:dev` or `yarn start` for live environment

If wanted, the code can be compiled to JavScript with `yarn build`, use `yarn built` to run the JavaScript with nodejs
